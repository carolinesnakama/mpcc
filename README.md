# mpcc
Implementation of the classic algorithm for MPCC proposed in 
Sven  Leyffer,  Gabriel  Lopez-Calva,  and  Jorge  Nocedal.  “Interior  methods  formathematical programs with complementarity constraints”. In:SIAM Journalon Optimization17.1 (2006), pp. 52–77

Things to know:
- File "mpcc.jl" should be in the same folder when running both case studies. 
- This implementation needs version 0.21.1 of JuMP.
- "case_study1.jl" corresponds to the first example in the above paper (ralph2).
- "case_study2.jl" is the suggested problem from the Nonlinear programming book.
